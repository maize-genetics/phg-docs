# Compare PHG variants to existing variants

## Quick Start

1. Change Truth_set.vcf, `param3`, and `param4` in your config file to match file paths on your computer.
2. Run phg VCF_compare [config.txt]

## Process Details

This process does not exist formally at the moment.  But one can imagine basically specifying a trustworth VCF with high confidence SNPs and comparing to those variants imputed from PHG and computing accuracy.
