# Align WGS fastq files to reference genome

## Quick Start

After making sure that config file parameters match paths on your computer, run
```
#!bash

CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy -[hd] -config [dbConfigFile]
```

## Details

This step allows you to load Haplotypes into the Database. Currently we support inputs from WGS fastq files, BAM files of WGS reads aligned to a reference, or a GVCF file.

Steps to the full pipeline:

1. Check to see if the reference is BWA and fai indexed
  * If not, index using bwa, samtools, and picard
2. Align WGS fastq files to the reference using bwa mem
3. Sort and MarkDuplicates in the output BAM file
4. Filter the BAM file based on Minimum MapQ
5. Run HaplotypeCaller using GATK or Sentieon
6. Filter the GVCF file
7. Extract out the reference ranges and load the haplotypes to the database

This page describes the CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy script, which runs all 7 steps.

If you have data from multiple formats, we suggest running CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy first on all fastq files, then CreateHaplotypesFromBAM.groovy on all BAM files, and finally CreateHaplotypesFromGVCF.groovy on all GVCF files.

## Kitchen Sink

This Groovy Script will create haplotypes originating from a FastqFile specified in a [keyfile](CreatePHG_step2_haplotypeKeyfile.md). This groovy script can be run by itself outside of the docker, but you will need to be sure to set up the output directories correctly. This script's steps can be viewed here: [CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy](https://bitbucket.org/bucklerlab/practicalhaplotypegraph/src/master/docker/buildFiles/scripts/groovy/CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy) If you also have some BAM files aligned for the same taxon you can include these as well.

Note only records with type FASTQ, BAM and GVCF will be processed by this script. FASTQ records will be aligned to the the reference using BWA MEM.  Then all output BAM files along with the keyfile BAM records will be run though HaplotypeCaller and filtered. Then the GVCFs coming out of HaplotypeCaller will be added to the DB along with the GVCF records in the keyfile.

This Groovy Script will open up the [keyFile](CreatePHG_step2_haplotypeKeyfile.md)(location is specified as the LoadHaplotypesFromGVCFPlugin.keyFile entry in the config file) and will loop over all FASTQ records and run BWA MEM to create BAM files. Then all BAM records in the keyfile and those output by BWA MEM are run through GATK/Sention's HaplotypeCaller. If multiple BAM files are stored for a given taxon, they will all be input for that taxon's HaplotypeCaller run. The resulting GVCFs will then be filtered and uploaded along with GVCF keyfile records to the DB. If multiple GVCFs are stored for a given taxon, each GVCF will be treated as an independent haplotype.

There are many parameters used by this step, all of which can be set in the config file.  The paths here assume the user has setup directory via MakeDefaultDirectoryPlugin:
#### File Directories.
* gvcfFileDir=/phg/inputDir/loadDB/gvcf/
    * The Output GVCF file Directory.  If you need to keep these files, mount a local drive to this location
* tempFileDir=/phg/inputDir/loadDB/temp/
    * The Temp file directory.  This Location is used to make any intermediate files when processing.
* filteredBamDir=/phg/inputDir/loadDB/bam/filteredBAMs/
    * After Filtering the BAM files by MapQ, the files are written here.  Mount a local drive to this location if you need the bams.
* dedupedBamDir=/phg/inputDir//loadDB/bam/DedupBAMs/
    * After filtering and Deduplication, the BAM files are stored here.  It is strongly suggested to mount to this location as BWA alignment does take some time.

#### TASSEL parameters
* Xmx=10G
    * Max Java Heap Space used when running TASSEL code.
* tasselLocation=/tassel-5-standalone/run_pipeline.pl
    * Location of TASSEL on machine.  If using PHG docker this is the correct location

#### PHG CreateHaplotypes Parameters
* referenceFasta
    * Reference fasta file location.  **This is Required.** Note, if using Docker, this needs to be the Docker specific path to the reference file.  You will need to mount these files to the Docker in order for it to work.
* wgsKeyFile
    * Location of the [keyfile](CreatePHG_step2_haplotypeKeyfile.md). **This is Required.** Note, if using Docker, this needs to be the Docker specific path to the keyfile.  You will need to mount this file to the Docker in order for it to work.
* LoadHaplotypesFromGVCFPlugin.gvcfDir
    * Directory of the GVCF files you wish to upload. **This is Required.** Note, if using Docker, this needs to be the Docker specific path to the gvcfs.  You will need to mount these files to the Docker in order for it to work. **Note: This needs to match gvcfFileDir in the config file.**
* LoadHaplotypesFromGVCFPlugin.referenceFasta
    * This should be set to the same location as referenceFasta. **This is Required.**
* LoadHaplotypesFromGVCFPlugin.haplotypeMethodName=GATK_PIPELINE
    * This is the method name which you are going to write to the DB.  **This is Required.** If you attempt to upload the same gvcfs and do not change this an error will be thrown.
* LoadHaplotypesFromGVCFPlugin.haplotypeMethodDescription
    * This is the description for the haplotypeMethodName.  If this is not set and empty description will be written to the DB.  It is **strongly** suggested that you put something in this field.
* extendedWindowSize=1000
    * This Script will extract out the Focused reference ranges from the Database into a BED file.  When doing the BAM file filtering, we allow the user to add flanking regions around each of the regions.
* mapQ=48
    * Minimum MapQ value allowed in the BAM file filtering.  This is to reduce the number of reads which map to multiple locations across the genome.

#### GATK and Sentieon Parameters
* gatkPath=/gatk/gatk
    * Location of GATK on this system.  This is the location within the PHG docker
* numThreads=10
    * Number of threads requested to run HaplotypeCaller.  
* sentieon_license
    * If you have access to Sentieon and wish to use it, provide the sentieon license here.  The Script will automatically attempt to use Sentieon if this parameter is specified.
* sentieonPath=/sentieon/bin/sentieon
    * This is the Docker specific path to sentieon.  If sentieon is installed somewhere else on your system, change this parameter.

### *Details on running this step with wrapper scripts*

When running this step on the command line, all file paths and parameters are set in the config file. If you would like to overwrite the parameters set in the config file, you can do that by setting the parameters on the command line directly.


### *Details on running this step through docker*

An example Docker script to run the CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy script is:

```
#!bash
REF_DIR=/workdir/user/DockerTuningTests/InputFiles/Reference/
FASTQ_DIR=/workdir/user/DockerTuningTests/InputFiles/WGSFastq/
DB=/workdir/user/DockerTuningTests/DockerOutput/phgTestMaizeDB.db
CONFIG_FILE=/workdir/user/DockerTuningTests/DataFolders/LoadRefDataDocker/config.txt
CONFIG_FILE_IN_DOCKER=/tempFileDir/data/config.txt
GVCF_OUTPUT_DIR=/workdir/user/DockerTuningTests/DockerOutput/gvcfOut/
KEY_FILE=/workdir/user/DockerTuningTests/DataFolders/LoadRefDataDocker/keyfile.txt
KEY_FILE_IN_DOCKER=/tempFileDir/data/keyFile.txt


docker run --name small_seq_test_container --rm \
        -w / \
        -v ${REF_DIR}:/tempFileDir/data/reference/ \
        -v ${FASTQ_DIR}:/tempFileDir/data/fastq/ \
        -v ${DB}:/tempFileDir/outputDir/phgSmallSeq.db \
        -v ${CONFIG_FILE}:${CONFIG_FILE_IN_DOCKER} \
        -v ${GVCF_OUTPUT_DIR}:/tempFileDir/data/gvcfs/ \
        -v ${KEY_FILE}:${KEY_FILE_IN_DOCKER} \
        -t maizegenetics/phg /CreateHaplotypesFromFastq.groovy -config ${CONFIG_FILE_IN_DOCKER}


```

Note the -w / parameter.  This is needed to guarantee that the script will run correctly.  When running a normal docker, this is likely not needed, but if running on a system like cbsu, the working directory needs to be set to the root directory.

### *Files*

**Haplotype keyfile**

Information on the keyfile format is here: [Haplotype keyfile](CreatePHG_step2_haplotypeKeyfile.md) 

**Reference fasta**

The reference genome in fasta file format

### *Steps*

#### **Index reference fasta**

BWA, samtools, and picard are used to index the reference fasta if index files are not already present.

#### **Align fastq files using bwa mem**

Fastq files are read from the fastq directory are aligned to the reference genome. After all are aligned the script verifies that BAM files for all taxa exist. The BAM is indexed and Picard is used run to MarkDuplicates.

#### **Call the [CreateHaplotypesFromBAM.groovy](CreatePHG_step2_addHapsFromBAM.md) script**

## Troubleshooting

1. Check that paths and filenames are spelled correctly in the config file.
2. Make sure the key file is formatted correctly and included in the config file.
